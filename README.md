# 🚀 MLCLI – Build ML Pipelines. Talk to Your Data.

### MLCLI is a modular CLI toolkit that lets you automate the full machine learning pipeline and interact with your data like never before. Just provide a CSV and enjoy:

🔍 Smart Task Detection (classification/regression) <br>
📊 Fast Data Handling using Dask <br>
🧠 LLM-Assisted Pipeline Planning via LLaMA 3.3 70B <br>
⚙️ Auto Preprocessing & Feature Engineering<br>
🤖 AutoML Training with PyCaret<br>
📉 Metric Reporting (Accuracy, R², F1...)<br>
💾 Joblib Model + Pipeline Saving<br>
💬 Interactive Data Chat Mode – Ask natural language questions about your dataset (e.g., “Top 5 categories by sales”) using Groq LLM<br>
📂 Metadata Output for reproducibility<br>

MLCLI isn’t just automation—it’s collaboration between you, your data, and AI. Speak to your dataset, build smarter models, and never touch a Jupyter Notebook again. ✨
